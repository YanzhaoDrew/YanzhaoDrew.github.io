I am currently a Bachelor's student in Artificial Intelligence at South China Normal University.

I am a self-motivated and disciplined researcher with strong problem-solving skills, specializing in Federated Learning (FL) and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures. And I have a strong focus on Video-LLM (VLLM) innovation and Video Diffusion methodologies, passionate about machine learning and continual learning. Actively contribute to the academic community as a Reviewer for AAAI-2024 and CVPR-2025.

I will begin my Ph.D. program at Hong Kong Baptist University (HKBU) in Fall 2026.

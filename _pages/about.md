I am currently a Bachelor's student in Artificial Intelligence at South China Normal University. (Sep 2022 â€“ Expected Graduation: Fall 2026)

I am a self-motivated and disciplined researcher with strong problem-solving skills, specializing in Federated Learning (FL) and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures. And I have a strong focus on Video-LLM (VLLM) innovation and Video Diffusion methodologies, passionate about advancing Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) for scalable codebase maintenance, including issue resolution and long-term optimization. Actively contribute to the academic community as a Reviewer for AAAI-2024 and CVPR-2025.
